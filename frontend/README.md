# DApp Frontend

Very basic Web-Frontend for a smart contract.

The frontend will connect with Metamask to an Ethereum blockchain. The default smart contract address is from a smart contract deployed to the Rinkeby network. Switch the network in Metamask to interact with it. Also some Rinkeby Ether for the Gas is required. 

## Installation

```bash

# Install
npm install

# Start
npm run serve

# open your browser. Usually http://127.0.0.1:8080
